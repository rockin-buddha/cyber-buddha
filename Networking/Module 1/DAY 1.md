# WHAT IS A NETWORK
---
- A network is collection of nodes, connected together so that they can exchange data such as voice, video, storage, or management
# CHARACTERISTICS OF A NETWORK
---
- HIGH BANDWIDTH
- LOW LATENCY
- HIGHLY AVAILABLE
- SCALABLE
- SECURE

# NETWORK COMPONENTS
---
- Network Components include end nodes and intermediate nodes
- **End Nodes :**
	- Compute Nodes, Storage Nodes and Management Nodes
	- Source or Destination of the traffic carried in a Network
- **Intermediate Nodes :**
	- Switches and Routers 
	- Receive the traffic generated by the **End Nodes** 
	- Make decisions where to forward the traffic

# FORMING A NETWORK
---
- Every node has a **NETWORK INTERFACE CARD (NIC)**
- **NIC** is a hardware component that resides in a slot and has one or more Network Ports
# PROTOCOL SUITE
---
- For the end nodes to be able to communicate with each other, they must implement the same Communication Protocols
- Each Protocol is responsible for Specific set of Activities
-  Each protocol defines a common format and set of rules for Exchanging messages between devices :
	- **Setup and Termination of data Transfer Sessions** 
	- **Message Format** 
	- **Error and System Message Handling**
- **PROTOCOL SUITE** : A group of protocols that run concurrently to implement the Network Communication

# OPEN SYSTEMS INTERCONNECTION
---
- OSI model breaks down the different components of Network Communication into Layers to make the communication Easier
- OSI is an ISO Standard model that describes 7 layers a computer system use to communicate over the Network
- Generic and Protocol-Independent Standard
![[MODULE_1/IMAGES/OSI.png]]

# TCP/IP
---
- Implementation of OSI Model
- Has 4 Layers
- Used as the protocol for the Internet
![[MODULE_1/IMAGES/OSI.png]]
## TCP/IP PROTOCOL SUITE
---
+ TCP : TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL
+ IP : INTERNET PROTOCOL
+ Includes protocols that specifies how data is :
	+ PACKETIZED
	+ ADDRESSED
	+ TRANSMITTED
	+ ROUTED
	+ RECEIVED
![[MODULE_1/IMAGES/TCP-IP.png]]

>[!IMPORTANT]
>LAYERS OF DIFFERENT PROTOCOLS SHOULD **ALWAYS** BE **REFERENCED** TO **OSI MODEL**
>
>Example : 
>- INTERNET LAYER PROTOCOL : IPv4, IPv6 :: **LAYER 3**
> - TRANSPORT LAYER PROTOCOL : TCP, UDP :: **LAYER 4**
>- APPLICATION LAYER PROTOCOLS : HTTP, FTP :: **LAYER 7**

### ENCAPSULATION
---
- Application messages created by application layer are passed to a **PRODUCTION LINE** of the lower layers
- Each Layer adds its relevant information in a process known as **ENCAPSULATING** the data with a Layer Header
- Header is the supplemental data placed at the beginning of a block of data
- Supplemental data is used at the receiving side to extract the data from the encapsulated data packet
- This packing of data at each layer is known as **DATA ENCAPSULATION**
- The encapsulated data is then transmitted on the wire

#### PROTOCOL DATA UNITS
---
- Each Layer is associated with Protocols, PDU's(Protocol Data Units) addresses and Devices
#### APPLICATION LAYER
---
- **MESSAGE** : Data generated at the Application layer for Network Transmission 
- It is then encapsulated at its lower layer, **TRANSPORT LAYER**

#### TRANSPORT LAYER
---
- Adds a layer 4 header like Port Number that are relevant for Transport Layer processing at the Receiving Node 
- **TCP SEGMENT or UDP DATAGRAM**  : A message encapsulated with a Layer 4 Header
- TCP Segment or UDP Datagram is handed over to Internet Layer

#### INTERNET LAYER
---
- Encapsulated with Layer 3 Header containing Source and Destination IP Addresses
- **PACKETS** : Layer 3 PDU's
- Packets are **ROUTED** in the network by Layer 3 devices called **ROUTERS**
- Packets are Passed down to Data Link Layer

#### DATA LINK LAYER
---
- Adds a Layer 2 Header containing Source and Destination MAC Addresses
- **FRAMES** : Layer 2 PDU's
- Frames are forwarded in Local network by Layer 2 Devices called **SWITCHES**
- Frame is transferred to Layer 1

#### PHYSICAL LAYER
---
- Frames are converted into **STREAM of BITS**
- This stream of bits is placed on **NETWORK MEDIUM** for Transmission

# DATA TRANSFER
---
- Goal of a Network : **Data Transfer**
- Remote application generates messages which are exchanged between two applications
- For applications to be able to understand each other, they must implement **SAME PROTOCOL**

# APPLICATION LAYER PROTOCOLS
---
- For each Application, application Layer Protocol provides the interface to Networking Services
- Application Layer provides network services to data generated by applications
- When Application Layer Protocol tries to communicate with remote application, it hands over the data to Transport Layer
- Some application Layer protocols use TCP as Transport Layer while others prefer UDP as transport Layer

## HTTP
---
- HTTP : **HyperText Transfer Protocol**
- Application Layer Protocol
- Allows exchange Text and Logical Link between nodes
- **HTTPS** : Secured variant of HTTP
- Functions as REQUEST-RESPONSE Protocol in CLIENT_SERVER Computing Model
- Client submits an HTTP request message to server
- Server returns a response message to the client
- Response contains the request completion status information and Requested content in its message body

## FTP
---
- FTP : **File Transfer Protocol**
- Application Layer Protocol
- Used to Transfer files between Hosts
- FTP users may connect anonymously (if server is configured to allow it) or may authenticate themselves with clear-text sign-in protocol (normally in the form of a username and a password)
- Can be used for secure transmission that protects the username and the password and encrypts the content

# TRANSPORT LAYER PROTOCOL
---
- Responsible for establishing end-to-end logical communication channels between applications (source and destination)
## FUNCTIONS
---
- Facilitating the communicating host to carry on a conversation
- Providing an interface for the users to the underlying network
- Asking for layer 3 protocols to carry the data to the destination
- Providing a reliable connection
- Carry out error checking, flow control and verification

- **TCP and UDP** : Two most commonly used Protocols

## TCP
---
- TCP is a reliable, connection-oriented transport protocol
	- **Connection Oriented :** Connection is established prior to transmission between the source and destination
	- **Reliable :** TCP uses sequence numbers and acknowledgements(ACK's) to recover from damage or loss of data
	- **Flow Control :** TCP allows the receiver to govern the amount of data sent by the sender. TCP uses a "WINDOW" size to indicate the allowed number of bytes the sender may transit before receiving further permission
	- **Ordered Delivery :** Sequence numbers are used to order the segments
- Applications that require reliability use TCP as their transport layer protocol
- TCP reliability mechanisms create overhead that slows down data transfer
- For applications that require fast light-weight transport service, TCP is not best choice

### TCP SESSIONS
----
- For 2 application processes to communicate over TCP,
	- A connection must be established
	- Once a connection is established, data can be transferred
	- TCP uses a keep-alive feature to keep connections open and manage them
		- **Keep alive** feature verifies that the period at the other end of the connection is still available. It is a mechanism used to detect broken or inactive connections between two endpoints. It works by periodically sending small, empty packets (keepalive probes) to the peer. If the peer responds with an acknowledgment, the connection is deemed alive. If no acknowledgment is received after a certain number of attempts, the connection is considered dead and terminated
	- After the data transmission is complete, the connection is terminated and all the allocated resources are released

### THREE WAY HANDSHAKE
---
- TCP connections are established using "**THREE WAY HANDSHAKE**" process
-  It is a 3 step method designed to allow both communicating ends to initiate and negotiate parameters of their connections before data such as HTTP and SSH is transmitted
- It requires both peers to exchange 3 synchronisation and acknowledgement messages before actual data communication begins
#### STEPS
---
- Client sends a synchronisation message to the server
	- Objective : Ask or infer if server is open for new connections
- When server receives the synchronisation message from the client, it responds and returns a confirmation receipt
	- The acknowledgement message or SYN ACK message 
	- This acknowledgement indicates that the server correctly acknowledges the clients message and that its sending its own synchronisation to be acknowledged as well
- Client receives the SYN ACK from the server and responds with its own acknowledgement message
- Each side must acknowledge the synchronisation message of the other side
- Upon completion of this process, the connection is created and the client and server can communicate

### TCP RELIABILITY
---
- TCP is reliable as the protocol ensures that the data is not damaged, lost, duplicated or out of order
- TCP ensures that all data is fully transmitted and can be assembled by the receiver in the correct order
- TCP achieves this reliability by assigning sequence number to each octet it transmits and requiring a positive Acknowledgement (ACK) from the receiving peer
- If the acknowledgement is not received within the time-out interval, the data is retransmitted
- At the receiver, sequence numbers are used to correct the order of segments that  may be received out of order and to eliminate duplicates

### FLOW CONTROL
---
- The sender sends data in a faster rate than the receiver is capable to process. In such a scenario, excess data is dropped and TCP will retransmit the dropped data
- **FLOW CONTROL** is the process of managing the rate of data transmission between two nodes to prevent a fast sender from overwhelming a slow receiver
- Receiver controls the transmission rate by sending feedback to the sender

>[!NOTE]
>**FLOW CONTROL MECHANISM** : Adjust the transmission rate

### TCP FLOW CONTROL
---
- TCP implements a flow control mechanism
- To control the amount of data sender sends, the receiver will advertise its receive Window size
- **RECEIVE WINDOW SIZE** : The spare room and the receiver buffer or the number of bytes it is prepared to receive before an acknowledgement is sent
- Window size is dynamically adjusted - increased or decreased as needed
- Each side controls its receive window size independently

## UDP
---
- **UDP**: USER DATAGRAM PROTOCOL
- Data is continuously sent to recipient whether it is ready to receive it or not
- Re-transmission of data is not supported
- Packets arrive out of order
- Provides a procedure for applications to communicate with each other with a minimum protocol overhead
- UDP is an unreliable, connectionless protocol
	- **CONNECTIONLESS** : No session establishment
	- **UNRELIABLE** : No ACK's and no re-transmissions
	- No flow control
	- No ordered delivery
- Performance : 
	- Low on resources
	- Less bandwidth
	- Faster transfer rates
- It is not ideal for sending e-mail, viewing a web page or downloading a file
- It is largely preferred for real-time applications like voice or video

## PORT NUMBERS
---
- Transport Layer Protocols such as TCP and UDP use source and destination port numbers to identify the specific process within the local and remote nodes
	- **DESTINATION PORT** : A well-known number identifying service requested on the remote server
	- **SOURCE PORT** : Dynamically allocated number identifying the process that sends data
- 16 bit in size ranging from 1 too 65535. Port number 0 is reserved
- Port numbers int he range of 0 to 1023 are the well known ports that are used by common TCP/IP applications
- Some well known Port Numbers
	- **80 : HTTP**
	- **21  : FTP**
	- **22  : SSH**
	- **53  : DNS**
	- **110 : POP3**


# INTERNET LAYER PROTOCOLS
---
## INTERNET PROTOCOL (IP)
---
- IP operated on the Network Layer
- IPv4 and IPv6 are  Network Layer Protocols
- IP provides network services to Layer 4 protocols such as TCP and UDP and asks Layer 2 protocols to carry the packets over the Medium
- IP is a best effort protocol and relies on Upper Layer Protocol Mechanisms 
- It does not include mechanisms for Reliability, Flow Control and Sequencing

### IP SERVICES
---
- IP provides the functions necessary to deliver a packet from a source to a destination over an interconnected system of networks
- Transport layer protocols operate end-to-end
- Internet protocol operate between any 2 directly connected layer 3 nodes
- To fulfil the functionality, IP provides the following :
	- Layer 3 addressing
	- Layer 3 Packet format
	- Routing Functionalities when routing occurs one router after another or hop-by-hop
### IP ADDRESS
---
- An IP address is assigned to a network interface of a node
- IPv4 address is a sequence of 32 bits divided to 4 groups of 8 bits per group known as **OCTETS**
- The 4 Octets are separated with a dot or period (.) for readability
- Each octet is represented by its decimal equivalent known as **DOTTED DECIMAL NOTATION**

### IP SUBNETS
---
- IP address contains 2 parts
	- **NETWORK ADDRESS** : 
		- Identifies the network portion of the address
		- Identifies the systems that are located on the same subnet
	- **HOST ADDRESS** : Identifies a specific host within a network (Subnet)
![[MODULE_1/IMAGES/IP-Subnet.png]]
- Every router interface defines an IP subnet
- All hosts in the same subnet shares a common subnet address
- In the figure, there is a router with 3 network interfaces. Hence 3 subnets are defined
- Network address for all host in Subnet A is 192.168.1.0
- The fourth octet represents the host unique address within the subnet

### IP ROUTERS
---
- **ROUTING** : Process of choosing the best path to reach the destination
- **ROUTER** : Computer that has been dedicated to the task of forwarding IP Packets between networks
- A router makes forwarding decision based on its forwarding database called a **ROUTING TABLE**
- **ROUTING TABLE** includes entries that map remote IP Networks to next hop routers that are identified by local interfaces
- Routing occurs one router after another or hop-by-hop
